## Usage

This section explains how to run the Blackjack simulation program and use its features effectively.

### Running the Simulation

To start a simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Activate the Environment**: Make sure the `blackjack-env` is activated:
   ```bash
   conda activate blackjack-env
   ```
2. **Run the simulation**: Execute the main script to start the simulation:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
   You can choose the pre-trained AI model by directly modifing the `q_table_filename` parameter in the main script before running it.

   - **Gameplay**
     - **Dealer's Hand**: The dealer's initial hand will be displayed at the top with one card face down and one card face up.
     - **Player's Hand**: Your hand is displayed openly at the bottom.
   - **Options**
     - **Hit**: The dealer's initial hand will be displayed at the top with one card face down and one card face up.
     - **Stand**: Click the `Hit` button to draw another card.
     - **Restart**: Resets the game to start a new round.
     - **AI Play**: Allows the AI to play the game automatically based on the trained model.

   - **Demo**

</div>
    
4. **(Optional)Retrain your own model**: Customize `train.py` by adjusting the configuration settings:

   Here are the main options you can configure:
  
   - **q_table_filename**: Specifies the path to a pre-trained Q-table. Set this to `None` to start training from scratch.
   - **num_states**: Defines the size of the state space that the AI agent considers. It's a tuple representing the dimensions of the Q-table.
   - **num_actions**: The number of possible actions the AI can take in any given state.
   - **learning_rate**: Determines how much new information overrides old information. Higher values make the agent learn faster but can lead to unstable training.
   - **discount_factor**: Indicates how much future rewards are valued over immediate rewards. Closer to 1 means the agent values future rewards more highly.
   - **exploration_rate**: The probability of the agent choosing a random action over the best-known action. This helps the agent explore new actions rather than exploiting known strategies.
   
   To modify these settings, locate where the `BlackjackAI` instance in `train.py` is created and adjust the parameters accordingly. For example:
    
   ```python
   ai_agent = BlackjackAI(
       q_table_filename='ai_models/pretrained_model.npy',
       num_states=(31, 31),
       num_actions=2,
       learning_rate=0.1,
       discount_factor=0.95,
       exploration_rate=0.1
   )

## Results

Our Blackjack Simulation utilizes AI to learn and optimize strategies over multiple episodes. Below, we present a series of results that illustrate the AI's learning progression and decision-making effectiveness over time. These insights are critical for understanding the impact of different training durations and settings on AI performance.

### AI Performance Improvement Over Episodes

This plot shows the AI's win rate and loss rate over a logarithmic scale of training episodes:

![AI Performance Improvement Over Episodes](results/performance_plot.png)

- **Observations**:
  - The win rate stabilizes after around 10,000 episodes, indicating that additional training yields diminishing returns.
  - Loss rates decrease initially but plateau, suggesting the AI reaches a strategy limitation under current configurations.

### Detailed Game Outcomes

We also analyze the game outcomes in terms of wins, losses, and draws. The following plots show these metrics after different simulation runs:

#### Simulation Outcomes After no Episodes (Benchmark)

![Blackjack Simulation Outcomes - 0 Episodes](results/wld_0.png)

#### Simulation Outcomes After 100 Episodes

![Blackjack Simulation Outcomes - 100 Episodes](results/wld_100.png)

- The increase in the number of losses correlates with a more aggressive strategy adopted by the AI as it explores more state-action pairs.

#### Simulation Outcomes After 10,000 Episodes

![Blackjack Simulation Outcomes - 10,000 Episodes](results/wld_10000.png)

- An increase in wins and a decrease in draws suggest an improvement in strategic decision-making by the AI.

#### Simulation Outcomes After 1,000,000 Episodes

![Blackjack Simulation Outcomes - 1,000,000 Episodes](results/wld_1000000.png)

- The improvement of performance is limited over this stage, implying that the AI reaches a strategy limitation under current configurations.


### Analysis and Discussion

The collected data demonstrate that while the AI significantly improves with initial training, there's a plateau effect in performance improvement. This is aligned with the the expectation in Blackjack, which, even with perfect play, is often below 50% due to the house edge.
